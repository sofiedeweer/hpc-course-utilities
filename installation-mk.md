# Installation of dependencies: mk modules

## 1. What are mk modules?

[mk modules](https://github.com/elauksap/mk) bundle a set of scientific libraries compiled under the same toolchain. Once installed, they provide the command module, that has several subcommands:
- `module load`: loads the requested module. This creates a set of environment variables storing relevant paths for that library (e.g. `mkEigenPrefix`, `mkEigenInc`, ...). Use  `export | grep "mk "`  to obtain a list
- `module list`: shows a list of currently loaded modules
- `module avail`: shows a list of all available modules (loaded or not)
- `module --help`: shows a list of all the commands

## 2. Install on a native Linux distribution

If you have a computer with a Linux operating system, you can install mk modules directly or skip to step 3.
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/elauksap/mk/releases)
2. Extract it:
```bash
sudo tar xzvf mk-version.tar.gz -C /
```
3. To use the modules run `source /u/sw/etc/profile`. I you want to avoid typing it every time you open your terminal, modify your `~/.bashrc` file by adding
```bash
# mk.
export mkPrefix=/u/sw/
source ${mkPrefix}/etc/profile
module load gcc-glibc
# module load <module_name> for any other needed module
```

## 3. Install using Docker

### 3.1 Linux or Mac
For computers running on Linux or Mac, you can skip to step 3.3.

### 3.2 Windows
Since Docker relies on sharing a Linux kernel with its host you will lose some performances by running Docker on Windows. Moreover, Docker is avaiable on Windows only for the following versions:
* Windows 11 64-bit: Home or Pro version 21H2 or higher, or Enterprise or Education version 21H2 or higher.
* Windows 10 64-bit: Home or Pro 21H1 (build 19043) or higher, or Enterprise or Education 20H2 (build 19042) or higher.

To check you version press WINDOWS + R, enter `winver` and press OK. If your version is compatible with Docker you can decide to either use Docker (skip to 3.2) or use a dual boot (skip to 3.2.1). If you do not meet the requirements, you will need to use a dual boot (skip to 3.2.1).

#### 3.2.1 Dual Boot
Dual-booting is the act of installing two operating systems on a single computer, and being able to choose which one to boot. In particular, you will need to install a Linux distribution, we suggest Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS. 

To do this you can follow the [official guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) (which is a bit dated) or this [unofficial tutorial](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/).

After you are done you can either install the mk modules natively (step 2) or on Docker (step 3.3).


### 3.2 Install
1. Install Docker following the instruction on the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Please read it thoroughly.
2. From a terminal with admin privileges pull the Docker image:
```bash
docker pull elauksap/mk
```
3. The image is just a snapshot of the state of a Linux OS, it is like a saving point from where you want to start. You can check your images with `docker image ls`.

4. To use your image you need to create a Docker container. To make a parallel with virtual machines, the Docker image is like the .iso of the OS, but then you have to install it. We want to create a container with the image we have just downloaded, give it a name (`--name hpc-courses-mk`) to remember its function and share a folder with the host so that we can exchange file easily (`-v /path/to/host/folder:/root/shared-folder`). The complete command is:
```bash
docker run --name hpc-courses-mk -v /path/to/host/folder:/root/shared-folder -it elauksap/mk
```
**WARNING:** to avoid problems `/path/to/host/folder` should not contain white spaces or special characters. For instance you can make your shared folder with the command `mkdir shared-folder` and than `/path/to/host/folder` would be `C:/Users/matteo/shared-folder` on Windows or `~/shared-folder` on Linux-like OS.

5. We can check our containers and their status with the command 
```bash
docker ps -a
```
6. Once you have created your container remember to **do not** use again the commad `run` but just `start` and `stop`. Otherwise you will create every time a new container. For instance to turn on the container and jump into it:
```bash
docker start hpc-courses-mk
docker exec -it hpc-courses-mk /bin/bash
```
7. Inside the container you can quit with `exit` and then stop the container with `docker stop hpc-courses-mk`.

8. If you want to remove a container you creaded for mistake you can run:
```bash
docker rm <name-of-the-container>
```

Always remember that documentation is your best friend! Do not panic, just type:
```bash
docker --help
```

## 4. Test the installation

1. Create a file `test-installation.cpp` with content:
```cpp
#include <Eigen/Eigen>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    std::cout << "Successfully included Eigen." << std::endl;
    return 0;
  }
```

2. Make sure the Eigen module is loaded: `module load eigen`

3. Compile and run the test:
```bash
g++ -I ${mkEigenInc} test-installation.cpp -o test-installation
./test-installation
```
